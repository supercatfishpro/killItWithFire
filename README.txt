KillItWithFire is a top down classic RPG that aims to test and possibly engineer new AI algorithms. These algorithms will include a text based chat system with NPC 
villagers, and also a specialized level up system in which enemies have multiple skills they may use, when these skills allow an enemy to survive an attack or 
kill another enemy/player that skill will level up. A reproduction system will be implemented upon a later date.

This program currently includes a Globals class that manages the screen output, game logic, and game data.

There is a map object that is a 2D vector array of tiles that have basic properties for player and ai interaction.

There are also tile objects that make up the map, they have basic properties such as colidable, which interact with the player.
